The code in this repository is part of the Dreagle structure. 

We are developing a product that provide to home users a Free Drones zone for their home airspace. 

The Code is divided in two parts, **User Interface** and **Hacking Interface**. 



##Hacking and Controling Snippets

During the instalation of the Dreagle System, plenty of codes were used for hacking and controlling. For hacking we used the code of @samyk, to know more, visit his amazing repo of [SkyJack][1], which is used for hacking Parrot Drones.

Most of the controlling snipets are using [Ardrone Autonomy][2] from @eschnou, which offers an interesting interaction with the Drone, including even meter mesurements and tag detection.

##User Interface
If you are willing to adapt this code, you can also consider using our [User Interface][3] for editing the config.js file.


##! Important !
###This is a drop folder, use it with carefull and test it always in controlled environments.
